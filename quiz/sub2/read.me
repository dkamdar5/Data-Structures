Accessing the loop files may be hard, since spaces usually denote the end of a 
filename in linux.  To view the contents of the file "endless loop", you can 
use the command

cat "endless loop"

or

cat endless\ loop

Either way will work.  The backslash version is helpful if you happen to be already
typing and forgot to start off with the initial quotes.
